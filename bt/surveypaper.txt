Survey Report: Types of Blockchains and Real-Time Use Cases
1. Introduction

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple nodes in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way. It is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend far beyond digital currencies. This report explores the types of blockchains and their real-world use cases.

2. Types of Blockchains

Blockchain networks are categorized based on access, governance, and participation. The main types are:

2.1 Public Blockchain

Definition: Open and permissionless blockchains where anyone can join, read, write, and validate transactions.

Characteristics:

Decentralized and transparent

Secure due to consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake)

No central authority controlling the network

Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin

Real-Time Use Cases:

Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum

Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries

NFT Platforms: Open marketplaces for digital art and collectibles

2.2 Private Blockchain

Definition: Permissioned blockchain with restricted access, usually managed by a single organization or consortium.

Characteristics:

Faster transaction speeds

More control over participants and data privacy

Suitable for enterprise use

Examples: Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, Quorum

Real-Time Use Cases:

Supply Chain Management: Tracking shipments, verifying authenticity

Enterprise Data Sharing: Secure internal record-keeping

Banking and Finance: Cross-border payments and trade finance

2.3 Consortium (Federated) Blockchain

Definition: Partially decentralized blockchain governed by a group of organizations rather than a single entity.

Characteristics:

Controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes

Combines benefits of public and private blockchains

Efficient and energy-saving compared to public blockchains

Examples: Energy Web Foundation, IBM Food Trust

Real-Time Use Cases:

Interbank Transactions: Banks collaborating on a shared ledger

Healthcare Data Exchange: Multiple hospitals sharing anonymized patient data

Supply Chain Networks: Consortium of suppliers and manufacturers tracking goods

2.4 Hybrid Blockchain

Definition: Combines features of public and private blockchains, allowing selective access.

Characteristics:

Controlled access for private operations

Public transparency where needed

Flexible and scalable

Examples: Dragonchain, XinFin

Real-Time Use Cases:

Government Services: Public access to non-sensitive data and restricted access to sensitive data

Real Estate: Public property listings and private ownership records

Healthcare: Patient data shared with authorized medical staff while public health statistics remain visible

3. Comparison Table of Blockchain Types
Type	Access	Governance	Use Cases	Examples
Public	Open	Decentralized	Cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFTs	Bitcoin, Ethereum
Private	Restricted	Centralized	Enterprise data, supply chain	Hyperledger, Corda
Consortium	Semi-Open	Group-controlled	Interbank networks, healthcare	Energy Web, IBM Food Trust
Hybrid	Mixed	Mixed	Government, healthcare, real estate	Dragonchain, XinFin
4. Conclusion

Blockchain technology is versatile and can be adapted to different needs. Public blockchains are ideal for open, trustless systems, while private and consortium blockchains suit enterprise and regulated environments. Hybrid blockchains offer a balance between transparency and privacy. Real-time applications across finance, supply chain, healthcare, and government highlight blockchain’s transformative potential.
