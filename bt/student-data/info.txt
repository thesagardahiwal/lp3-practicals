Step 1: Open Remix IDE

Go to https://remix.ethereum.org
.

Create a new file called Student.sol.

Explanation:

struct Student → stores student details.

Student[] students → dynamic array to store multiple students.

addStudent() → adds a new student.

getStudent() → fetches student details by index.

fallback() → allows contract to accept Ether.

getContractBalance() → checks balance of contract.

Step 3: Compile the Contract

Click Solidity Compiler → Compile Student.sol.

Make sure there are no errors.

Step 4: Deploy on Test Network

Click Deploy & Run Transactions → Environment → Injected Provider - MetaMask.

Connect MetaMask to Remix.

Make sure MetaMask is on a test network (Goerli or Sepolia).

Click Deploy → Confirm in MetaMask.

Wait for deployment to finish. You’ll see Contract Address in Remix.

Step 5: Interact with the Contract

Add Students

Select addStudent → enter _id, _name, _age, _course → Transact → Confirm in MetaMask.

Observe Gas used and Transaction fee in MetaMask.

Check Student Count

Click getStudentCount → Call → shows number of students.

Get Student Details

Click getStudent → enter index → Call → shows student info.

Send ETH to Contract

Send small ETH via fallback function.

Check getContractBalance() → Call → shows contract balance.

Step 6: Record Gas and Transaction Fees

You can create a table in your practical report:

Operation	Gas Used	Transaction Fee (ETH)	Notes
Deploy Contract	112,000	0.00021	Deployment
Add Student	45,000	0.00008	Student addition
Send ETH to Fallback	21,000	0.00004	Accept Ether
