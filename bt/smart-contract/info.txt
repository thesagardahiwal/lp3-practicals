Step 1: Installing MetaMask
Choose a Browser
MetaMask works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave.
Open your browser and go to https://metamask.io.


Download & Install
Click “Download” → Choose your browser.
Install the extension.

Set Up MetaMask Wallet

After installation, click the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar.

Select “Get Started” → “Create a Wallet”.

Set a strong password.

Backup your Secret Recovery Phrase safely (don’t share it with anyone).

Confirm the recovery phrase.

✅ Now your wallet is ready.

Step 2: Add Test Ether

For studying transaction costs, use the Ethereum testnet to avoid spending real money.

Switch to a Test Network

Open MetaMask → Click the network dropdown at the top (it usually says “Ethereum Mainnet”).

Select “Goerli Test Network” (or Sepolia).

Get Test Ether

Go to a faucet website for the testnet:

Goerli faucet: https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/

Sepolia faucet: https://faucet.sepolia.dev/

Enter your wallet address (MetaMask → click account name to copy).

Receive test Ether (it’s free).

Step 3: Study Spending Ether per Transaction

Each Ethereum transaction costs gas, which is paid in Ether.

Send a Small Transaction

Open MetaMask → Click “Send”.

Enter a recipient address (can be your own secondary wallet address for testing).

Enter a small amount (e.g., 0.01 ETH).

Choose “Low / Medium / High” gas fees and notice the difference.

Click “Next” → “Confirm”.

Observe Gas Fee

After sending, MetaMask will show:

Transaction Fee (in ETH)

Gas Used

Total Cost

You can also check on the block explorer:

Go to https://goerli.etherscan.io
 (or Sepolia explorer)

Paste your transaction hash.

Look at Gas Price, Gas Used, and Transaction Fee.

Experiment

Try different gas settings.

Send different amounts of Ether.

Record how the transaction fee changes.
